Use HDF5 as data store.

## Collectors

A Collector is a class which defines how to capture a data point based on
various parameters.

For example, let's say we define a class `grasshook.collectors.HTMLSelector`
which loads a HTML page and takes a certain element's text content as its
value. The class should implement a `collect()` method which gathers the data
and commits it to the database.

## Configuring Collectors

A configuration file should contain collector aliases followed by a dictionary
of parameter values to be passed to the collector. For example:

html-selector:
  url : http://twitter.com
  username : dexyit
  selector : a[data-nav=followers] strong

Here url, username and selector are parameters which are passed to the `collect()` method.

## Collect Method

The `collect()` method should create and populate a new row in the data table.

## Controller

A controller should check whether a data table exists in the specified
location, initialize it if not, or open it in append mode if so, then load and
parse the config file and process each collector.
